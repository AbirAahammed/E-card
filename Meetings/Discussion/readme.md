# About

All Discussions outside of github are posted here. This does not include meetings themselves, only live chats that are to be documented.

Our communication software of choice is Discord.

This discussion is exported with a [DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter) created by Alexey Golub.

See Communication.txt for our general discussion throughout the course and project.

See Meeting-Schedule.txt for an overview of our scheduled meetings.
